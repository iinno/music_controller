Improvements to make:

   Design:
     - Routing should probably be done in App.js rather than homepage.js

   Project:
     - Maybe use webpack-server rather than just webpack. Add Hotmodule

     - Dockerize or use virtual env
  

   Etc/Problems:
     - Webpack was being fairly slow when using VS Code as the IDE, adding the following helped:
```
watchOptions: {
  poll: true,
  ignored: /node_modules/
}
```
And this also if you are using Ubuntu 20.0:
```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```
