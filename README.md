# Music Controller
Created a music controller webapp using React and Django based on a tutorial.

# To run the app
 - Make sure that you have Django installed and djangorestframework modules installed through either pip or something else: `pip install django djangorestframework`
 - `cd` in to `/frontend` and run `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies.
 - From the top level, use the command `python manage.py runserver`
 - Inside the frontend directory (react) run the command `npm run dev` or `npm run build`
