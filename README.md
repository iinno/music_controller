# music_controller
Creating a music_controller webapp using React and Django.

# To run the app:
 - Make sure that you have Django installed and djangorestframework modules installed through either pip or something else: `pip install django djangorestframework`
 - `cd` in to `/frontend` and run `npm i` to install all the necessary dependencies.

# For the future:
 - I intend to dockerize the app so running it will be easier.
